                    <p>I'm a highly motivated developer and student from Tennesse. I adore building accessible, responsive and performant code. Furthermore,
                        I'm also a huge fan of open-source.

                        I have been building web apps for almost 4 years and still love it. Learning something new every week. The main purpose of site is to showcase the skills learned over the 4 years.

                    <p>Hey there! Let's get straight to it! I'm Juan, a motivated frontend developer.
                        I started back when I was a 16-year-old kid that had an extreme passion for creating stuff,
                        building simple static web pages and expanding my CSS knowledge by recreating awesome designs. I've 
                        continued to gro and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, at the age of 20, four years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using
                        the latest technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Typescript and much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you will find me blasting down a race track. There's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline that
                        comes from going ultra-fast, and for me, there's no better way to experience that than in my Nissan 370z.

                <p class="blog-short-desc">
                    First, let me introduce myself. My name is Juan Garcia, I'm a self-taught full-stack developer with 1 year experience. 
                    In that time, I've worked as a front-end developer for a startup called Zyndicate.
                    <br><br>
                    This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my first year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. 
                    This is because I had no real experience doing web development - and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic html and css training I got from a few online courses. 
                    I also didn't have a computer science degree since I couldn't afford college.    
                    <br><br>
                    I started working with Amazon without knowing if I would ever get to work as a software engineer. 
                    I always felt like I didn't know enough coding to where I could even get a job. Eventually, I heard about Amazon Career Choice. Upon doing research, I found this could be another opportunity to advance in life and get a better chance at securing a job.
